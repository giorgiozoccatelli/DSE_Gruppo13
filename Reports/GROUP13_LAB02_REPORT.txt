\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this laboratory activity is to implement both known elementary units already seen in the previous lab activity such as multiplexers and new units such as decoders, comparators or shifters and connect them not only to the switches but also to the 7-segment displays on the FPGA in order to obtain different types of decoders. 

\section{Controlling a 7-segment display}
\subsection{Design Entry}
The aim of the first exercise is to get familiar with the 7-segment display by implementing a decoder that takes as an input a 3-bit array and gives as an output the display of one of the four letters forming the world "Hello" according to a given truth table. Of course with a 3-bit array we can configure up to eight different configurations so half of the arrays will return a blank display. In order to obtain this result we implement a simple design called \textit{lettere.vhd} that includes both the decoder and the pin connection to our display on the FPGA called \textbf{HEX0}. Notice that the convention is to assign the logical value '1' if we want to turn off a segment while we assign the logical value '0' if we want to turn on a segment.
\subsection{Functional Simulation}
In this functional simulation we impelement a testbench trying to display the entire word "HELLO" one letter at a time. Once the world has been displayed we try one of the blank configurations that will turn off the display.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Tb_es1.png}

    \label{fig:Tb_es1}
\end{figure}
The piece of code shown in \hyperref[fig:Tb_es1]{Figure 1} refers to the file 
\textit{lettere\_tb.vhd}.
\subsection{Synthesis}
We complete our exercise by adding the two files \textit{lettere.vhd} and \textit{lettere\_tb.vhd} to a new ModelSim project in order to synthesize our project before downloading it on the FPGA.

    \label{fig:wave_es1}
\end{figure}
In \hyperref[fig:wave_es1]{Figue 2} we can see the transision between the letter "H" and the letter "E".

\section{Multiplexing the 7-segment display output}
\subsection{Design Entry}
In this exercise the aim is to implement a circuit that displays a word chosen between "HELLO", "CELLO", "CEPPO" and "FEPPO" eventually shifting their letters. We use in part previous implemented designs including them in a single top entity to describe the entire circuit. In particular we need these components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 4-to-1 multiplexer used to choose one of the four world we want to display (for this purpose we allocate the switches SW\textsubscript{1-0}.
    \item A shifter driven by the switches SW\textsubscript{4-2} used to decide if we want to shift the word.
    \item A 7-segment decoder to actually see the word displayed for which we need the displays HEX\textsubscript{4-1}.
\end{itemize}
All these components correspond to the files \textit{mux.vhd}, \textit{shifter.vhd} and \textit{display.vhd} which are then declared and connected in the top entity design called \textit{mux\_shifter\_design}. We don't spend much words about the single designs because they're almost all a natural extension of the previous exercises, while we point out that in the top entity we declare two internal 15-bit wide signals \textit{a1} and \textit{a2} to connect the three designs: the signal \textit{a1} will be the output of the multiplexer and the input of the shifter as well as the signal \textit{a2} will be the output of the shfiter and the input of the display. 
\subsection{Functional Simulation}
In the functional simulation \textit{mux\_shifter\_decoder.vhd} we want to implement the testbench of four different words configurations in \hyperref[fig:Tb_es2]{Figure 3}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Tb_es2.png} 
    \caption{7-segment display wave analysis}
    \label{fig:Tb_es2}
\end{figure}
We implement four different words with four different shift to cover most of the possible configurations.
\subsection{Synthesis}
In the final part of the simulation made on ModelSim, we upload as always the design files as well as the testbench and we look at the wave analyzer to check if the output is correct.

\end{figure}
In \hyperref[fig:wave_es2]{Figure 4} we can notice the transition between the word "ELLOH" and the word "PPOCE". We are now ready to download our design on the FPGA.

\section{Binary-to-BCD converter}
\subsection{Design Entry}
Similarly to the previous excersise, the description of a top-level design is created through the use of two different components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{converter\_Binary-to-BCD}
\item \textbf{display}
\end{itemize} 
The first, described in \textit{converter2.vhd}, has the task of converting the 6-bit binary number (input) in the respective decimal number (output) using the  BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) representation that allows to obtain a decimal number from the combination of 4-bit binary representations. 
\\Before realizing the actual design of the converter, we have to make some considerations.\\ A 6-bit binary number, covers at most 2\textsuperscript{6}-1 values, meaning that the maximum decimal value is 63. This also means that the first digit \textit{z} that appears on the HEX1 display varies from a minimum value of 0 to 6, while the second, that appears on the HEX0 display, ie \textbf{\textit{m}} can vary from 0 up to 9.\\ To implement this, multiple comparators are used to divide different cases on the basis of the value of the tens digit, that is \textit{z} and then determining the value of \textit{m} or ones digit in the following way: 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{design_lab2_es4.PNG} 
    \caption{Binary-to-BCD converter design description}
\end{figure}
\\For the description of the display design, we use the \textit{display.vhd} code used in excersise 2 (section 2.1) that performs the same function. 
\subsection{Functional Simulation}
To test the correct functioning of the design, a testbech called \textit{converter2\_display\_tb.vhd} is created, in which 6-bit test values are assigned to SW\_tb. The following configurations are chosen to cover all possible eventualities.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{tb_lab2_es4.PNG} 
    \caption{Binary-to-BCD converter testbench configurations}
    \label{fig:testbench_es4}
\end{figure}
\\As it can be seen from the \hyperref[fig:testbench_es4]{Figure }, the test signals also verify the functioning of the blank display, in addition to the most classic numerical configurations.
\subsection{Synthesis}
SW\_tb signals are then analysed using ModelSim. The correct functioning of the implementation is verified by the evolution of the logical signals, as shown in \hyperref[fig:waveform_es4]{Figure } below.\\
Every 20 ns a configuration change is made with a consequent change in the trend of the logical waves, but always in accordance with the expected results.

\\In \hyperref[fig:waveform_es4]{Figure } we are seeing the transition between the first and the second configuration reported in section 5.2.
