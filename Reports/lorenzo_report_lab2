\section{Binary to decimal converter}

\subsection{Design Entry}
We start by defining the top-level entity, called \textit{converter\_display.vhd}. The architecture of this entity is composed of two components, the \textit{converter} and the \textit{display}, which have a different function.
\\
The \textit{converter} (described in \textit{converter.vhd}), takes as input the 4-bit number, expressed by the four switches SW\textsubscript{3-0} and converts it by defining \textit{z} and \textit{m}, respectively the first and second digit of the number expressed in decimal.
\\
By the fact the 4-bit input number has $2^4-1 = 15$ as maximum number in decimal unit, it is correct to represent \textit{z} only as '0' or '1', so in order to compose the code, it is sufficient to only control if the value of the number is more than 9 to have $z = 1$ or less to have $z = 0$ .

The \textit{display} (described in \textit{display.vhd}), takes as input \textit{z} and \textit{m} and gives us as output respectively the HEX1 and HEX0 display. The way this works is already explained in the 2.1 section.

\subsection{Functional Simulation}
In order to test the design, the testbench (called \textit{converter\_display\_tb}) is created. Here we assign signals to SW\_tb and we test the some of the possible configuration (the chosen ones can be seen in the \hyperref[fig:tb_lab2_es3.png]{figure})

\subsection{Synthesis}
Eventually the signals used in the testbench are analysed using ModelSim. Following the procedure also used in the other laboratory experience, we can verify the correctness of the testbench and the signals, and we get the \href{fig:waveform_lab2_es3}{figure}, where in this case the configuration for the number 9 and the number 4 are verified.
