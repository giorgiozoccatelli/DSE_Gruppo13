%Entry design
The One Hot state machine, implemanted in the file \textit{one\_hot\_fsm.vhd} takes advantage of 9 flip-flops (forming a register) and of two different signal types:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{current_state} indicating the current state of the machine; 
\item \textbf{future_state} indicating the future state of the machine.
\end{enumerate}
These cases are encoded by a 9-bit binary sequence in which a single bit equal to '1' varies in order to distinguish one state from another.\\
The functioning of the machine consists in returning '1' as output (\textbf{LEDR0}) following the detection of a sequence of at least 4 identical bits in input (\textbf{SW1}) indistinctly whether they are 0s or 1s and overlapping is allowed.

%Functional Simulation
The description of the testbench is done in the file \textit{one\_hot\_fsm\_tb.vhd} using the clock signals \textbf{KEY0\_tb}, reset \textbf{SW0\_tb} and input \textbf{SW1\_tb}.

%Synthesis
In Figure 1, obtained through Modelsim, it can be observed that the results are consistent with the expectations. In fact, after receiving for 5 consecutive clock cycles an input value equal to '1', the output assumes the logical value '1' and then falls back to '0'.

--------------------------
As seen in \textit{version2.vhd} the working principle of the exercise is very similar to the previous one, the only substantial difference lies in the encoding of machine states that now have a '1' in the LSB, except for the machine reset state expressed as a 9-bit binary sequence of 0s.\\
As expected the results obtained by the testbench \textit{version2\_tb.vhd} on Modelsim are the same as the previous exercise, the only difference is the state code as described above.
